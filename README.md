## Comments
I couldn't figure out how to get the shadow to show up under the main image
without using set heights, so I ended up moving the background image (shadow) from
the CSS to the HTML. This doesn't seem right, but at least it was working. Actually,
on second thought I probably should just have moved both images to the CSS as
the background, maybe? ...
